# Tips
- all muscles has to be trained at different-different angles
- do sets till failure
- muscle growth occurs with the **progressive overload **and proper protein supply
- MUSCLE-Mind Connection
- good routine of 3-4-6 days, i have managed to learn, implement it and change out exercises and increase the load
# Tracking Progress
- **Pick your weekly schedule** (Routine A, B, or C).
- **Log sets, reps, and loads** every workout; add weight once you hit top of rep range on all sets two weeks in a row.
- **Insert the push-up and pull-up progressions** after main lifts or on rest days (they take <10 min).
- **Use bio-feedback:** any joint pain or persistent soreness → substitute yoga/mobility for HIIT that week
- **Deload every 4th week:** cut volume in half but keep weight to maintain neural groove
## Tracking Progress
1. **Body metrics:**
- Scale weight (fasted) 2×/week
- Waist at navel 1×/week
1. **Gym log:** record load / reps every set—aim +2-3% load or +1 rep weekly.
1. **Photos:** front/side/back monthly; assess recomposition visually when scale stalls.
1. **Biofeedback:** Rate sleep quality, stress, joint pain daily (1-5). If average drops ≥1 point, add mobility/yoga in place of HIIT for a week.
# Choosing a schedule
- **Look at your week on Sunday night.**
- If you can train **2–4 days**, pick Routine A or Routine B.
- If you see **5–6 free slots**, run Routine C.
- **Keep weekly set targets consistent.** Each plan delivers 9–15 “hard” sets per major muscle, the evidence-based sweet spot for size & strength in intermediates
- .
- **Slide between programs without penalty.** Same core lifts appear across all three, so technique and progression tracking stay seamless.

# Push-Ups Progression
## Push-Up Progression
| Level | Variation | Goal to Advance | Why It Works | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 1 | Wall Push-Up | 3×20 crisp reps | Loads ~40% bodyweight | 
| 2 | Incline Push-Up (bench) | 3×15 | Gradually increases load as bench lowers | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 3 | Knee Plank Hold | 3×30 s | Builds core tension for straight-body line | 
| 4 | Negative Floor Push-Up | 3×5 with 5-s lower | Strengthens eccentric range where you’re strongest | 
| 5 | Full Floor Push-Up | 3×8-12 | Standard strength benchmark; drop to knees if form breaks | 
| 6 | Weighted/Archer Push-Up | 3×8 each side | Progressive overload once bodyweight reps >20 | 
**Cue Sheet**
- Hands just wider than shoulder width, elbows ~45° from torso.
- Maintain a **rigid plank** (glutes + quads tight) throughout descent and press.
- Chest to elbow height = full ROM. Use yoga blocks as “touch targets” if needed.

# Bench Dips - form

# Bench Dips Progression
## Bench Dip & Chest Dip Substitutes
Until shoulder stability improves, keep torso **upright**
on bench dips to bias triceps and minimize anterior shoulder stress. 
Progress load by elevating feet on a box, then adding a plate on lap. 
Avoid parallel-bar chest dips until you can perform 20 perfect bench 
dips pain-free.
# Pull Ups Progression
## Pull-Up Progression (Band-Free & Tall-Friendly)
| Phase | Exercise | Prescription | Advancement Target | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 1 | Bar Hang | 4×20 s holds | 4×40 s | 
| 2 | Scapular Pull-Up | 4×10 | Master shoulder depression | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 3 | Inverted Row (Smith bar hip-height) | 4×10 | Feet straight; chest touches bar | 
| 4 | Negative Pull-Up (jump to top) | 5×3 with 5-s lower | Control descent entire range | 
| 5 | Cluster Reps (¼ pull-ups) | 10 singles every 30 s | Nose clears bar each rep | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| 6 | Full Pull-Up | 3×AMRAP; add reps weekly | Once ≥6 reps, load with 2.5 kg plate | 
**Tall-Lifter Tips**
- Use a **high bar or power rack** so knees stay flexed but feet clear floor.
- Grip slightly wider than shoulder width; tall athletes often need extra ROM clearance.
- Combine core work (hollow holds) to keep body from swinging.
